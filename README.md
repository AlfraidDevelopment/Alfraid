# Alfraid
## Deadline 1
We made quite a few separate blueprint classes and widgets and are just starting to put them together to acutally make something.
Interactable Objects (All except MovableCube and DroppingCage can be used by getting close enough and pressing E): DroppingCage and CageSwitch, SwingDoor/Door_Wall1, PickUpObject/PickUpPipe, and MovableCube
Camera Blueprints: StaticCamera (Stays in one place but rotates to follow the player), HallwayCamera (Follows the player from an angled top down view), VentCamera (Follows the player for a sideview), CameraSetBox (Used to switch between camera types)
Widgets: TitleMenu (All buttons except Credits work), PauseMenu (Press Z to activate)
## Deadline 1 Viewing Steps
1. Make sure that you are in the GameTitle level (Can be found under Content>AlfraidWork>Levels-Worlds>GameTitle)
2. Press Play (Use any of the buttons except Credits [Hasn't been set up yet], the Settings button will lead to a text of all of the functions that will be in the game eventually)
3. Move through the level using WASD or the arrow keys and pressing E to open doors that are nearby (These are bugged but the blueprint works fine later). You will hit checkpoints that you can test by pressing Z and selecting Exit or Exit to Main Menu and then selecting Load.
4. Exit out of the game using the Exit button on the pause menu or esc and go to AlfraidGameLevel (Can be found under Content>AlfraidWork>Levels-Worlds>AlfraidGameLevel)
5. Once loaded, press play and move arround (Press E next to the pipe, doors, or swiches to activate them or move into the white cubes to move them around). There should be the three camera views in the level (Static on the left, Hallway in the middle, and Vent on the very right)
